# How to query using REST API

After creating a metadata and after creating contents, you will query your data.

With the parameters you can control a lot of things:

* condition in the query
* order of result
* pagination of query
* choose the selection field

If you need more power to querying your data, you should watch:

* [select queries](../select-queries.md)
* [conditions](../conditions/)
