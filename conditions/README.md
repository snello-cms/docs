# Conditions

## Parameter conditions

You should define the conditions that will bypass the normal queries on metadata table. The conditions can be applied on different parameters in "and " or "or" combination.

You can apply the conditions on parameters in some way:

* \_nn
* \_nie
* \_gt
* \_gte
* \_lt
* \_lte

And you can mix the conditions using "&&" or "\|\|".

```
$ give me super-powers
```

{% hint style="info" %}
 Super-powers are granted randomly so please submit an issue if you're not happy with yours.
{% endhint %}

Once you're strong enough, save the world:

```
// Ain't no code for that yet, sorry
echo 'You got to trust me on this, I saved the world'
```
