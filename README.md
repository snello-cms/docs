# Snello CMS

## How SNELLO is born

PHP vs Java vs Angular 2: a challenge among webmasters!

## Why create a NEW CMS in 2019?

To test/try/taste new frameworks \(like  Micronaut in java without using Hibernate\) and how to generating dinamically forms in typescript \(Angular &gt;2\)

## The power of queries!

Normally in headless cms, you can create only table and make queries. We want enpower the query side:

* filters a gogo
* select queries \(custom queries on metadata\)
* conditions \(add where conditions, in presence of some request parameter\)
