# Snello CMS

## How SNELLO is born

PHP vs Java vs Angular 2: a challenge among webmasters!   
Strapi strongly inspired: we are java developers! we can make betters on server side performance.  
RESTQL vs GraphQL: More options on traditional REST frameworks.

We are professional developers: all open source projects are born to following some ideas. Also in SNELLO, we are testing/trying/tasting new frameworks \(like  Micronaut in java, pure persistence of data without using Hibernate\) and how to generating dynamically forms in typescript \(Angular 8\)

## RESTQL: the power of queries!

Normally in headless cms, you can create only table and make queries. We want enpower the query side:

* filters a gogo
* select queries \(custom queries on metadata\)
* conditions \(add where conditions, in presence of some request parameter\)
